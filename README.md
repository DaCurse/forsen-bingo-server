# forsen-bingo-backend

Backend for [forsen-bingo](https://github.com/DaCurse/forsen-bingo), used to collect data about which squares are clicked the most.

**Make sure to mount database and SSL cert folders when running the container so they will match up with env variables in [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile).**
